### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**maggickkw/maggickkw** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Frontend engineer mainly working with react-native
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning and data structures
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more backend and machine learning projects and build things that help
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my backend development. Sometimes i can get stuck
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I love video games so we can try that too. But reach out to m with projects even if its just for fun, i can learn a thing ot two.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: you can send me a message on linkedIn, Wilberfore Sedem Haibor
- âš¡ Fun fact: I support Manchester United
